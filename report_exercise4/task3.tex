\begin{qa}
	\question{What is the maximum frequency of your design?}
	\answer{According to the compilation report, $f_{max} = 73.07MHz$ at 85Â°C with
	performance optimization turned on. When the critical path is excluded (see
	next answer) the new $f_{max} = 90.19MHz$.}
	\question{Where is the critical path of your design?}
	\answer{The critical path is the forwarding data path,
	from data memory through MEMU and MEM via the EXEC forwarding mux through the
	ALU bit shift combinatorial logic finally to the alu\_next register
	in the MEM stage. BUT when this data path is activated, a stall is asserted
	by CTRL, so actually this path is not critical. When it is excluded,
	the next critical path is from the input register of EXEC via the FWD logic and aluB mux
	through the ALU bit shift logic to the alu\_next register
	in the MEM stage.}
