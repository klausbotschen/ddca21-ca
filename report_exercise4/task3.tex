\begin{qa}
	\question{What is the maximum frequency of your design?}
	\answer{92MHz with aggressive optimization at 85Â°C; with balanced mode $f_{max}=84.36MHz$.}
	\question{Where is the critical path of your design?}
	\answer{The critical path is mostly due to the forwarding, e.g.
	from WB wb\_next register via the EXEC forwarding mux through the
	ALU bit shift combinatorial logic finally to the alu\_next register
	in the MEM stage.}
